a post consists of--
	- a title
	- a score [used to call this 'phrase']
		- canvas element
		- metadata: composer, title, year
	- body text (commentary on the score)
	- the date of the post


TO DO:
- better models of posts
	- ability to sort by post author, music composer, music title, etc
- prettier views, maybe using a popular library
